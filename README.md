# Explainable-AI-101-Interpreting-Loss-Landscape

In this project, we aim to animate the learning process of the most widely used machine learning models in their simplest form as a web application/website. Such that it will be an end to end tool for understanding the working of Machine Learning algorithms by visual Learning and help educators/learners around the world.


# A sample visualization form our web application:

## Gradient Descent in a Neural Network:
